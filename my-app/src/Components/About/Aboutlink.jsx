                I‚Äôm Eihab (Pronounced ‚ÄúEe-hab‚Äù) a multi-disciplinary front-end

              <p>What I Do</p>
              <p>
                With two years of invaluable experience in my role at Harmony
                Technology ‚Äì‚Äì a tech company based here in Rabat, I have honed
                my skills in React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript,
                allowing me to craft seamless and interactive user experiences.
                During my time at Harmony Technology, I had the privilege of
                collaborating on projects for esteemed clients such as the
                Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of
                Justice. It was an incredibly rewarding experience to develop
                applications that directly impact the lives of Moroccan
                citizens.
              </p>
              <p>What I Do</p>
              <p>
                Before delving into the realm of front end engineering, I spent
                five years as a graphic designer. This background has equipped
                me with a keen eye for aesthetics and a deep understanding of
                user-centered design principles. It enables me to seamlessly
                blend functionality and visual appeal in every project I
                undertake.
